# Frame Plugins

This directory is intended for plugins that modify or interact with the main application frame or UI structure, outside the core Excalidraw canvas itself.

**Purpose:**
- Implement plugins that add custom panels, toolbars, menus, or other UI elements to the application.
- Manage the overall layout or integrate Excalidraw with a larger application shell.

**Current Status:**
- This directory is currently a placeholder. No specific frame plugins have been implemented yet. The main application layout is currently managed in `App.tsx`.
